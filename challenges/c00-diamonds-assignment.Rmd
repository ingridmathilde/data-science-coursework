*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you'll complete a large number of *exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring, documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these skills again and again in each challenge.

# Grading Rubric
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations | Documented observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not supported by analysis | All observations supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Team
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Documented | No team contributions to Wiki | Team contributed to Wiki |
| Referenced | No team references in Wiki | At least one reference in Wiki to member report(s) |
| Relevant | References unrelated to assertion, or difficult to find related analysis based on reference text | Reference text clearly points to relevant analysis |

## Due Date
<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due on the day of the class discussion of that exercise. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJTh2DH8nVJd2eyMMoyNGroReo0BKcJrz1eONi3rPSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

# Data Exploration
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and document your observations.

__q1__ Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Plot `price` vs `carat` below
## Your code here!
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point()
```

**Observations**:

Lowest carat diamonds (<0.5) will not be prices at more than $5000, while highest carat diamonds (>3.0) can be priced between $7500 to over $175000. There seems to be covariability between carat and price with several outliers.  

__q2__ Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

```{r q2-task}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below
## Your code here!
plot_point <- diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point()

plot_smooth <- diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
  geom_smooth()

plot_combo <- diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = cut)) +
  xlim(0,3.0) +
  facet_grid(~ cut) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
      title = "Diamond Carat (0.0-3.0) vs Price compared by Cut",
      subtitle = "A diamond must be either high cut quality or high carat to fetch a high price - if both, all the better!",
      x = "Carat (0.2 mg)", 
      y = "Price ($)"
      ) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = "bold"))

plot_point
plot_smooth
plot_combo
```

**Observations**:

The point plot is overwhelming and takes several tries to understand. After some time, I noticed that the better the cut, the more likely the diamonds is to get away with a higher price despite lower carats. Meanwhile diamonds that were only a lower cut happened to also be higher carat if they fetched a higher price.  

The smooth line plot is much less overwhelming to examine, though I worry it implies a stronger relationship than I perceive. The trends described with the point plots still apply but this plot reveals something interesting about our data: for each cut, our data does not span the same carats (though the data points for those with fewer data points are diamonds with a carat above 3.0).

This made we wonder if I should overlay the point and smooth plot and limit the x-axis (carats) to 0.0-3.0 and break the plot apart by cut. So I did this and the relationship is between cut, carat, and price is made all the more clear (aka the better the cut, the less the need to have a high carat diamond to fetch a high price). It also demonstrated that we may have more or less data per cut group - I wonder if this is a function of desirability while attempting to sell.

# Communication
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data Science Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

__q3__ *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your document in RStudio.

![Terminal](./images/c00-knit.png)

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

__q4__ *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

![Terminal](./images/c00-unstaged.png)

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files` folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to include all the files under that directory.

![Terminal](./images/c00-staged.png)

__q5__ *Document* your findings in our [Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki). Work with your learning team to come to consensus on your findings.

The [Datasets](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Datasets) page contains lists all the datasets we've analyzed together.

__q6__ *Prepare* to present your team's findings!

__q7__ Add a link to your personal data-science repository on the [Repositories](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Repositories) page. Make sure to file it under your team name!
